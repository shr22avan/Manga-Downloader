Manga Downloader using python

Requirements: BeautifulSoup
Somehow Install That

After that run python mangadownloader.py

Follow Instructions after that

Note::::
1) Path is preferably from mangareader.net. Enter the starting url unless you want to do something weird and stupid

2) The Destination Path must be properly define from a linux command line perspective. Especially, the path must be suffixed with a / otherwise it will not work the way you want it to.
